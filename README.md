# Assessment: Hierarchical Data and You
## Using Modified Preorder Tree Traversal(MPTT)

## Introduction
The purpose of this assessment is to learn about the Modified Preorder Tree Traversal(MPTT) and different ways of working with a multi-layered database. The MPTT will permit the treatment of data like a gigantic tree by starting with the "root" object and branching out to parents, siblings, and children.

In order to work with the MPTT, a Dropbox-esque web interface composed of folders and files in an arbitrary structure was created and that structure was displayed.
